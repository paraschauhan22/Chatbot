# Chatbot
This project aims to develop a web application that utilizes the ChatGPT API and Flask framework to create an interactive chatbot. The application allows users to ask questions or engage in conversations, and the chatbot provides appropriate responses based on the input received.
The Flask framework is utilized to create the web application, handling user requests and displaying responses. The ChatGPT API, provided by OpenAI, is used to integrate the powerful language model and generate meaningful replies. The application employs a conversational approach, maintaining a history of messages exchanged between the user and the chatbot to enable context-aware responses.
The chatbot functionality is implemented by sending user messages to the ChatGPT model via the API and receiving responses in return. The application handles the generation and display of responses to provide a seamless conversational experience for users. Additionally, the project allows for potential expansion with features such as intent recognition and integration of external APIs.
Ethical considerations are emphasized throughout the development process to ensure responsible and unbiased responses from the chatbot. The project promotes adherence to ethical guidelines by avoiding inappropriate or biased content, setting appropriate user expectations, and prioritizing the security and privacy of user data.
Overall, this web application project offers an opportunity to explore the capabilities of the ChatGPT model and Flask framework, creating an interactive chatbot that can effectively engage with users and provide relevant and helpful responses.
